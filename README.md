# Malaria detection with convolutional neural networks

This project was created as part of my bachelor thesis. My goal was to implement model, which would be able to detect malaria based on thin blood smear slide images. I proposed 4 different architectures of convoultional neural network, where each of them is included in different file.

# Setup

- I downloaded dataset from <a href="https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/publication/pub9932" target="_blank">`here`</a>
